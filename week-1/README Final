# Week 1: Machine Learning Fundamentals

This folder contains two foundational machine learning assignments focusing on basic algorithms and optimization techniques.

---

## 📁 Contents

### 1. Perceptron Algorithm (`perceptron.ipynb`)
Implementation of the perceptron learning algorithm with visualization of decision boundaries.

**Key Features:**
- Binary classification on 2D data
- Visual decision boundary evolution
- Convergence analysis
- Linearly separable and non-separable data experiments

**Topics Covered:**
- Perceptron weight update rule: `w = w + η * y * x`
- Linear separability
- Decision boundaries
- Convergence behavior

---

### 2. Linear Regression (`Week1_assignment2.ipynb`)
Implementation of linear regression using both closed-form solution and gradient descent optimization.

**Key Components:**

#### Task 1: Closed-Form Solution
- Direct matrix computation: `w* = (X^T X)^(-1) X^T y`

#### Task 2: L2 Loss Function
- Mean squared error: `L(w) = (1/n) Σ(y - w^T x)^2`

#### Task 3: Loss Derivative
- Gradient computation: `∇L = (-2/n) X^T (Y - Xw)`

#### Task 4: Gradient Descent
- Iterative optimization with convergence checking
- Learning rate: η = 0.001
- Max iterations: 10,000
- Convergence threshold: ε = 1e-15

**Outputs:**
- Trained weight vector
- Test error vs iterations plot
- Convergence statistics

```

**Option 2: Google Colab**
1. Upload notebook to https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Upload required dataset (dataset01.csv)
3. Runtime → Run all

**Option 3: VS Code**
1. Install Jupyter extension
2. Open .ipynb file
3. Click "Run All"

## 📊 Expected Results

### Perceptron
- **Linearly Separable Data:** Converges quickly (< 100 iterations)
- **Non-Separable Data:** May not converge within max iterations
- **Visualization:** Decision boundary evolution over training

### Linear Regression
- **Convergence:** Typically within 200-500 iterations
- **Test Loss:** Decreases exponentially
- **Final Loss:** ~0.01-0.05 (depends on dataset)

## 🧪 Experiments

### Perceptron Experiments
1. Different feature combinations
2. Varying noise ratios (0.1, 0.2, 0.3)
3. Different sample sizes (100, 500, 1000)
4. Learning rate variations

### Linear Regression Experiments
1. Different learning rates (1e-2, 1e-3, 1e-4)
2. Various initialization strategies
3. Different train/test splits
4. Comparison with closed-form solution

## 📈 Learning Objectives

**By completing these assignments, you will understand:**
- How gradient descent optimizes model parameters
- The difference between closed-form and iterative solutions
- Decision boundary concepts in classification
- Convergence behavior and stopping criteria
- The importance of learning rate selection
- Linear vs non-linear separability

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** `dataset01.csv not found`
- **Solution:** Ensure dataset is in the same folder as notebook

**Issue:** PyTorch not installed
- **Solution:** `pip install torch` or use `py -m pip install torch`

**Issue:** Perceptron doesn't converge
- **Solution:** This is expected for non-separable data. Try linearly separable data first.

**Issue:** JSON parsing error in Colab
- **Solution:** Download as "Raw" file from GitHub, not rendered version

## 📚 Key Concepts

### Perceptron
- **Update Rule:** Only updates on misclassified points
- **Convergence:** Guaranteed only for linearly separable data
- **Limitation:** Cannot solve XOR problem

### Linear Regression
- **Closed Form:** Fast but requires matrix inversion (O(d³))
- **Gradient Descent:** Scalable to large datasets
- **Learning Rate:** Too high → divergence, too low → slow convergence
